## Stuff I understood

A graphql comprises of 3 components

- A model of an entity
- A query type ( this has all the GET Endpoints you need for that entity ). For our case we have our rootquery type which is hooked up to the type of the entity
- A mutation which is used to CREATE, UPDATE and DELETE that entity

We can separate this with individual schemas
